# Computer Vision 2025

This repository contains activities, experiments, and exercises developed during my postgraduate studies in **Computer Vision** in 2025.

## 📚 Purpose

The goal of this repository is to document and store the practical activities I'm learning throughout the course, including image processing techniques, enhancement methods, and feature extraction using tools such as OpenCV and Python.

## 🧠 Topics Covered

- Image preprocessing (e.g., grayscale conversion, noise reduction)
- Contrast enhancement (CLAHE)
- Edge detection (Canny)
- Filtering techniques (Gaussian, median, etc.)
- Visualization and analysis using Python libraries

## 🛠️ Tools and Libraries

- Python
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
